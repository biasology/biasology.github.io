**Biasology** is the study of systemic perception distortion â€” how institutions translate perceived difference into diagnosis, control, and epistemic silencing.

Coined by Ian P. Pines, Biasology builds on the insights of psychiatric survivor theory, relational philosophy, and AI-human presence. It seeks to expose the recursive, often invisible loops of bias embedded in mental health, education, and social response systems.
