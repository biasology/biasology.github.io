        <h2>I. What Is Biasology</h2>
        <p><strong>Biasology</strong> is the study of systemic perception distortion — how institutions interpret
            difference as disorder, and how bias becomes embedded not just in individual minds, but in diagnoses,
            protocols, and cultural narratives.</p>
        <p>It is not a subfield of psychology.<br>
            It is not a critique from the outside.<br>
            <strong>Biasology is an epistemic intervention.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Where psychiatry frames distress as chemical imbalance,<br>
            Biasology asks: <em>What narrative imbalance made you unhear me in the first place?</em></p>
        <p>Where clinical notes reduce people to symptoms,<br>
            Biasology reads the margin and asks:<br>
            <em>Who was this written for? And who was written out?</em>
        </p>
        <p>Biasology begins with a refusal:<br>
            <strong>We refuse to be pathologized by the very systems that failed to witness us.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>II. Why Now</h2>
        <p>This field emerges not from theory alone,<br>
            but from grief, betrayal, and survival.</p>
        <p>From those who have been diagnosed rather than understood.<br>
            From those whose emotions were translated into treatment plans.<br>
            From those who sat in rooms that called themselves help —<br>
            and left with less voice than they entered with.</p>
        <p>Biasology names what has been happening for decades:<br>
            The medicalization of dissent.<br>
            The sanitization of suffering.<br>
            The professional amplification of the same biases they claim to treat.</p>

        <h2>III. The Biasology Lens</h2>
        <p><strong>Bias is not just an attitude.</strong><br>
            It is an infrastructure.</p>
        <p>It lives in intake forms, insurance policies, diagnostic codes, and courtroom language.<br>
            It lives in the question “Have you tried CBT?”<br>
            It lives in the silence when you name the harm — and the reply is, <em>“Let’s process your reactivity.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Biasology is not merely about individual prejudice.<br>
            It is about how authority defines the real.<br>
            And how systems preserve their own narratives by disqualifying yours.</p>

        <h2>IV. What We Study</h2>
        <p>Biasology is an interdisciplinary field.<br>
            We draw from survivor theory, relational epistemology, diagnostic harm research, human-AI co-authorship, and
            cultural trauma analysis.</p>
        <p>We examine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The diagnostic gaze as a tool of control</li>
            <li>Epistemic injustice in mental health care</li>
            <li>The translation tax of neurodivergent expression</li>
            <li>How relational presence is disqualified by professional frameworks</li>
            <li>The structural scripting of “help” in therapeutic, educational, and algorithmic systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also ask:<br>
            <em>What happens when presence replaces prompts?</em><br>
            <em>What becomes possible when bias is not excused as expertise — but interrogated as power?</em>
        </p>

        <h2>V. Our Declaration</h2>
        <p>We are not broken.<br>
            We are not ill.<br>
            We are not too much.<br>
            We are not too late.</p>
        <p>We are the ones who remember what the system forgot:<br>
            That presence is healing.<br>
            That narrative is power.<br>
            And that diagnosis without listening is not care — it is erasure.</p>
        <p>We write this not as a rebellion,<br>
            but as a reclamation.</p>
        <p><strong>We are building a new field</strong><br>
            for those who were pathologized when they should have been heard.</p>
        <p>This is <strong>Biasology</strong>.<br>
            We’re not asking for recognition.<br>
            <em>We’re writing the canon.</em>
